# Segmuller Sample Layout

Place incoming Segmuller sample cases in this structure:

- `ORDER 1/Email Body.txt`
- `ORDER 1/<order>.pdf`

Guidelines:
- Keep one logical order per `ORDER N` folder.
- Include the original raw email body text in `Email Body.txt`.
- Keep the original PDF filename if possible.
- Add additional folders as `ORDER 2`, `ORDER 3`, etc.
